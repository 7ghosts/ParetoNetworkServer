# ParetoNetworkServer

Frontand and Backend for calculating ranking and all other functions of the Pareto Network intel feed.

This implements two parts of the ranking algorithm so far, and can do a client side calculation first primarily for cosmetic purposes.

Client Side:
Gets current balance of Pareto holdings.

Server Side:
Gets weighted average of Pareto holdings.


web3.js can accomplish all aspects of this algorithm client side or server side, but I plan for more to happen server side as we make improvements for performance reasons, and also begin writing rankings in a database.
